# LoMarket

LoMarket is a fictional e-commerce. It was built using React and Redux in the 
frontend and Node in the backend. The checkout page has a cart that allows the user to 
increment and decrement the number of items while the total is updated with each 
increment click. Stripe is used to finalize the purchase of the items.
